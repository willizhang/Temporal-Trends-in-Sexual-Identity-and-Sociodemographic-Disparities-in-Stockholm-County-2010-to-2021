Willi Zhang, Per Tynelius, Maya B. Mathur, Matteo Quartagno, Gunnar Brandén, Fredrik Liljeros, Kyriaki Kosidou. **Temporal Trends in Sexual Identity and Sociodemographic Disparities in Stockholm, Sweden, 2010 to 2021.** 2025. _American Journal of Public Health. In Press._

The R scripts include:
* **SPHC-B-2010.Rmd:** analyses of sexual identity using SPHC-B 2010 dataset.
* **SPHC-B-2014.Rmd:** analyses of sexual identity using SPHC-B 2014 dataset.
* **SPHC-B-2021.Rmd:** analyses of sexual identity using SPHC-B 2021 dataset.
* **Summary_plots_cc.Rmd:** drawing summary plots from complete-case analyses.
* **Summary_plots_imp.Rmd:** drawing summary plots from multiple imputation analyses.

<small>_Notes:_ For simplicity, we use the term “SPHC-B + year” for the Stockholm Public Health Cohort (SPHC) baseline surveys, and “SPHC + year” for both baseline and follow-up surveys for a given cohort; for example, SPHC-B 2010 represents the baseline survey initiated in 2010, and SPHC 2010 denotes the cohort including SPHC-B 2010 and the follow-up surveys in 2014 and 2021. See Figure 1 below for an overview of SPHC surveys.<small>
